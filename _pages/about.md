I am a Machine Learning Researcher with a proven track record of success across both academia and industry. I have contributed to diverse projects spanning anomaly detection, time series forecasting, computer vision, remote sensing, computer networks, spatiotemporal data mining, multimodal learning and deep learning. I am a Machine Learning Software Engineer at Juniper Networks, where I focus on building machine learning solutions to tackle problems in the computer network domain. Some of my works at Juniper include building a time series forecasting solution for resource allocation ([presented at NANOG 86](https://youtu.be/vSNOcTfR4Ak)) and building a ML-driven multimodal network anomaly detection and root cause analysis solution. 


I hold a PhD in Computer Science from North Carolina State University (NC State). At NC State, I was a member of the Spatio Temporal Analysis and Computing (STAC) Lab under [Dr. Ranga Raju Vatsavai](https://rvatsavai.github.io/) where I conducted research on building machine learning solutions to tackle challenges in agriculture, climate change, and urban growth. My research was published in conferences and journals such as KDD, ICMLA, IGARSS, JSTARS and ICCS and workshops such as BigSpatial and SSTDM. My dissertation is titled "AgAI: A Machine Learning Framework for Agriculture". I also hold a Masters degree in Computer Science from University of Cincinnati, where my advisor was [Dr. Karen Davis](https://miamioh.edu/profiles/cec/karen-davis.html).
